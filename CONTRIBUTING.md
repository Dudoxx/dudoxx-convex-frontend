# Contributing to Dudoxx Convex Frontend

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Dudoxx Convex Frontend as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dudoxx-convex-frontend.git
cd dudoxx-convex-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check types
npm run typecheck
```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: We use strict TypeScript. No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **ESLint**: Follow the ESLint configuration. Run `npm run lint` to check
- **Prettier**: Code is automatically formatted with Prettier
- **Security**: Security-first mindset. All inputs must be validated
- **Testing**: Write tests for new functionality

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism
fix(ui): resolve theme switching issue in dark mode
docs(security): update authentication security guide
```

### Security Requirements

**üö® Security is our top priority. All contributions must:**

- Never expose backend endpoints to client-side code
- Validate all inputs on the server-side
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Log security events appropriately

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and authentication flows  
- **Security Tests**: Test for common vulnerabilities
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```
